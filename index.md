## Hi, I am Saketh. I am 6 years old. 

### I am still very young to be web hosting.

My dad does this on the side for me. So please expect fun stuff to be posted when he has time for my web needs. 

I live with my parents as I am not financially independent yet. Bay Area is expensive in general so it might take some time to have my own place and computer. 

I go to elementary school but like all kids I sulk to wake up early. But once I am awake, I love going to school and meeting friends and teachers. I love doing math, reading and writing. 

I like my soft toys a lot. I like watching TV and I "own" an iPad on which I regularly watch some shows. My parents are pretty strict about iPad time and installed parental controls on it. Some day, I will get rid of them. The controls not my parents.  

I love them both. They have their kinks but I can get along with them mostly. My mom is a fantastic cook and he makes many tasty dishes for our family. My dad, well he cleans up after me and tries to keep our house in top shape. 

I love playing chess. My grandpa taught me how to play. My mom, uncle and grandma are all very good playing chess. I also love playing video games, trivia and other games on my iPad.
