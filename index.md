## Hi, I am Saketh. I am 4 years old. 

### I am still very young to be web hosting.

My dad does this on the side for me. So please expect fun stuff to be posted when he has time for my web needs. 

I live with my parents as I am not financially independent yet. Bay Area is expensive in general so it might take some time to have my own place and computer. 

I go to pre-school but like all kids I sulk to wake up early. Fortunately, I am potty trained and can eat my food. 

I like my soft toys a lot. I like watching TV and I "own" an iPad on which I regularly watch some shows. My parents are pretty strict about iPad time and installed parental controls on it. Some day, I will get rid of them. The controls not my parents.  

I love them both. They have their kinks but I can get along with them mostly.
